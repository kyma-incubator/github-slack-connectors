## Overview

The Slack Connector is a component which allows contact from inside of Kyma environment to the Slack API.

## Installation in Kyma with Helm

### Prerequisites

- Connection to Kyma cluster
- Slack Connector Docker image

### Steps

1. Go to the [authentication page](https://auth-slack.herokuapp.com/). Click `Add to Slack`. This redirects you to another page. Select your desired workspace and click `Allow`.
    >**NOTE:** If the link does not work, it means that an application that authenticates the connector in your workspace does not exist and you have to create it yourself. To create such an application, see [this tutorial](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth#flow) in the Slack API documentation.

2. Copy the authentication token. You will need it later in the Helm command.
3. Go to [Kyma repository](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma) and run the script `/installation/scripts/tiller-tls.sh` to get certificates needed for using Helm commands. By default they are stored in `~/.helm` directory. After that add `--tls` flag to every Helm command to authorize and authenticate the user.
4. Go to the `chart/slackconnector` directory. Run this command to install the Slack Connector:

    ``` shell
    helm install --set container.image={DOCKER_IMAGE} --set kymaAddress={KYMA_ADDRESS} --set slackBotToken={SLACK_TOKEN} -n {RELEASE_NAME} . --tls
    ```

    >**CAUTION:** Make sure that the Kyma address is in the correct format. It consists of the domain name and omits the dot at the beginning. For example, `35.187.32.214.xip.io`.
    >**NOTE:** To define Namespace in which chart should be installed add flag `--namespace`.
